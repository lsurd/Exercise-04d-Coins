# project-04-platformer
-platformer with an otter theming with beachside/riverside themed animal enemies, and shells for coins. This was done working off of exercise 4d. 
-date: 3/16/25
## Implementation
-all sprites done personally including all obstacles, player character animation, and backgrounds
- background music is a combination of YM-kalimba FL LD3 Ebm and fountain 3 soundbite on Soundtrap, and shell collection tone was created on ChipTune
- an extra enemy design, and animation was done by myself, and added using the pre-existing flying enemy prefab
- there are multiple levels including a first and second with different assets themeing each level
- the ui utilizes the font Atop, created by GraphicSauce, and found on 1001 fonts, free for personal use.
- there is a small preamble at the main menu to attempt to clarify any confusion in visuals, and to give a stronger aesthetic to the platformer, as well as an attempt at a "score counter" on both the first and second level
- There was also an attempt at a more selective pallete primarily consisting of blues and purples which I tried to tie in specifically to the player design and main menu color scheme
